# Getting Started

This solution focuses on using VS Code as IDE and Node JS as our Angular Package Manager. Follow the following steps to install each one of them.

	1. Install latest version of node js 
	https://nodejs.org/en/
	
	2. Install Angular CLI as described below
	
	In Windows Command prompt, type the following
	npm instal -g @angular/cli

    3. Install VS Code - Latest Version
    https://code.visualstudio.com/

    4. Install GIT - Latest Version
    https://git-scm.com/download/win


By default VS Code and GIT will be integrated (latest version feature of VS Code). The only thing which is required is to connect to a specific repository.

    Use the following commands in git command prompt to connect to your account
    git config --global user.name "John Doe"
    git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com

If VS Code and GIT are not integrated by default as an editor, use the following command 
    git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
